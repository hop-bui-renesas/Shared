1,Number of channels,Two channelse
2,SPI transfer functions,"- Use of MOSI (master out/slave in), MISO (master in/slave out), SSL (slave select), and RSPCK (SPI clock) signals allows serial communications through SPI operation (4-wire method) or clock synchronous operation (3-wire method)<< - Transmit-only operation available - Communication mode selectable to full-duplex or transmit-onlye - Switching of RSPCK polaritye - Switching of RSPCK phase.<<"
3,Data format,"- MSB-first or LSB-first selectable( - Transfer bit length selectable as 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 24, or 32 bitse - 32-bit transmit and receive buffers.e"
4,Bit rate,". In master mode, the on-chip baud rate generator generates RSPCK by frequency-dividing PCLKB (the division ratio ranges from divided by 2 to divided by 4096)- . In slave mode, the minimum PCLKB clock divided by 4 can be input as RSPCK (the maximum RSPCKe frequency is that of PCLKB divided by 4) Width at high level: 2 PCLKB |cycles Width at low level: 2 PCLKB cycles.<<"
