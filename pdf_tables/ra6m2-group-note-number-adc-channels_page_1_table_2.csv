,Feature,Functional description
1,12-bit A/D Converter (ADC12),"Two units of successive approximation 12-bit A/D Converter (ADC12) are provided. Analog input channels are selectable up to 13 in unit 0 and up to 9 in unit 1. Each 2 analog inputs of unit 0 and 1 are assigned to same port (AN005/AN105, AN006/AN106), up to 20 ports are available as analog input. The temperature sensor output and an internal reference voltage are selectable for conversion of each unit 0 and 1. The A/D conversion accuracy is selectable from 12-bit, 10-bit, and 8-bit conversion, making it possible to optimize the tradeoff between speed and resolution in generating a digital value. See section 45, 12-Bit A/D Converter (ADC12)."
