1,General PWM Timer (GPT),"The General PWM Timer (GPT) is a 32-bit timer with GPT32 x 2 channels and a 16-bit timer with GPT16 x 2 channels. PWM waveforms can be generated by controlling the up-counter, down- counter, or the up- and down-counter. In addition, PWM waveforms can be generated for controlling brushless DC motors. The GPT can also be used as a general-purpose timer. See section 21, General PWM Timer (GPT)."
