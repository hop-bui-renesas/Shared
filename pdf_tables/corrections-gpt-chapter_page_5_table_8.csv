2,6,Inter channel cooperation synchronous clear setting (Source channel),"Set the GTINTAD register, GTCSR.CSCMSC[2:0] bit, and GTCR.SCGTIOC bit in the source channel of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear to enable synchronous clear. When complementary PWM mode, set GTINTAD of the master channel. In Figure 21.110, GPT320.GTCR.SCGTIOC bit is 1."
3,7,Inter channel cooperation synchronous clear setting (Cleared channels),"Set GTCSR.CSCMSC[2:0] bits in the cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear to select the counter clear by synchronous counter clearing group. In Figure 21.110, GTCSR.CSCMSC[2:0] bits of GPT321, GPT324, GPT325, and GPT326 is 111b."
4,8,Set group of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear,"Set the same value to GTCR.SSCGRP[1:0] bits in the source channel and cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear and set them in the same synchronous set/clear group. When complementary PWM mode, set GTCR of the master channel."
5,9,Enable inter channel cooperation synchronous clear,Set GTCR.SSCEN bits in the source channel and cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear to enable synchronous clear.
