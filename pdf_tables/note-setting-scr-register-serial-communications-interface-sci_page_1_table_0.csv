4,"We have found that a certain setting of the SCR register of the serial communications interface (SCI), which requires a cautionary note. This was not mentioned in the manual. The following paragraphs informs you of the setting that requires caution and also explains the changes to the manual to add this additional information.",,,,,,
5,Setting of the SCR register that requires caution,,,,,,
6,"In processing to make initial settings using products of the RX110 Group, RX111 Group, RX113 Group, RX210 Group, RX21A Group, RX630 Group, RX631 Group, RX63N Group, RX63T Group, RX64M Group and RX71M Group, if the TE, TIE, and TEIE bits in the SCR register are set to 1 at the same time, caution is required because this will lead to the generation of a TEI (transmit end interrupt) before a TXI (transmit data empty interrupt). This behavior is different than the behavior for RX610 Group, RX621 Group, RX62N Group, RX62T Group, and RX62G Group.",,,,,,
7,"In the serial communications interface (SCI) in products of the RX610 Group, RX621 Group, RX62N Group, RX62T Group, and RX62G Group, if the TE, TIE, and TEIE bits in the SCR register are set to 1 at the same time, a TXI (transmit data empty interrupt) and a TEI (transmit end interrupt) are generated simultaneously. As the timing with which the interrupts are actually generated depends on the product, caution is required on this point.",,,,,,
8,Details of manual revision (described with taking RX630 as the example),,,,,,
9,". On page 1096, the description in red has been added to section 32.3.5, SCI Initialization (Asynchronous Mode).",,,,,,
10,"Before transmitting and receiving data, start by writing the initial value ""00h"" to SCR and then continue through the procedure for SCI given in the sample flowchart (Figure 32.8). Whenever the operating mode or transfer format is changed, SCR must be initialized before the change is made.",,,,,,
11,"When the external clock is used in asynchronous mode, ensure that the clock signal is supplied even during initialization.",,,,,,
12,"Note that clearing the SCR.RE bit to 0 initializes neither the ORER, FER, nor the PER flags in SSR nor RDR. Moreover, note that switching the value of the SCR.TE bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 while the SCR.TIE bit is 1 leads to the generation of a TXI (transmit data empty interrupt) request.",,,,,,
