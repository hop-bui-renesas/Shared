1,1,DA1458x_DA1468x_CLI_PLT.exe needs all fields in params.xml configuration file to be filled-in even if these are not actually used by the current test setup.
2,2,The DA1458x memory programming may fail at 1M UART baud rate at some specific PCs and at a rate of around 1-2%. This can be solved by splitting the data to be burned into chunks (3960bytes is a good tested chunk) or lowering the UART baud rate to 115200.
3,3,"Sleep current measurement tests need production test firmware changes in order to power down the external peripherals used (e.g. sensors, memory flashes, etc.)."
4,4,'Modulation Index' measurement test using the Anritsu MT8852B does not work with MT8852B latest firmware version 5.00.004.
