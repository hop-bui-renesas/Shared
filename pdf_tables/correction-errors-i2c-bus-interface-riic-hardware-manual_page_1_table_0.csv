4,"In the applicable products mentioned above, there are some errors in the User's Manual: Hardware, regarding the description,",,,,,,
5,"example of flowchart, and operation timing (3) on the RIIC master receive operation.",,,,,,
6,"Therefore, we would like to correct them as follows. In the following, ""section xx"" represents ""section 22"" in the RX610 Group, ""section 30"" in the RX62N, RX621 Group, and ""section 23"" in the RX62T Group, respectively.",,,,,,

8,"5. After one byte of data has been received, the RDRF flag in ICSR2 is set to 1 on the rising edge of the eighth or ninth cycle of SCL clock (the clock signal) as selected by the RDRFS bit in ICMR3. Reading out ICDRR at this time will produce the received data, and the RDRF flag is automatically cleared to 0 at the same time. Furthermore, the value of the acknowledgement field received during the ninth cycle of SCL clock is returned as the value set in the ACKBT bit of ICMR3.",,,,,,
9,"6. When the next value to be received will be the final byte, set the WAIT bit in ICMR3 to 1 (so that waiting is applied) before reading ICDRR. This causes the SCLn line to be held low from the falling edge of the ninth clock cycle after reception of the next data (i.e. the final byte), enabling issuance of a stop condition. However, when the ICMR3.RDRFS bit is 0 and the slave device must be notified that it is to end transfer for data reception after transfer of the next (final) byte, set the ACKBT bit in ICMR3 to 1 (NACK).",,,,,,

After one byte of data has been received, the RDRF flag in ICSR2 is set to 1 on the rising edge of the eighth or ninth cycle of SCL clock (the clock signal) as selected by the RDRFS bit in ICMR3. Reading out ICDRR at this time will produce the received data, and the RDRF flag is automatically cleared to 0 at the same time. Furthermore, the value of the acknowledgement field received during the ninth cycle of SCL clock is returned as the value set in the ACKBT bit of ICMR3.Furthermore, if the next byte to be received is the next to last byte, set the ICMR3.WAIT bit to 1 (for wait insertion) before reading the ICDRR (containing the second byte from last). As well as enabling NACK output even in the case of delays in processing to set the ICMR3.ACKBT bit to 1 (NACK) in step (6), due to other interrupts etc., this fixes the SCLn line to the low level on the rising edge of the ninth clock cycle in reception of the last byte, so the state is such that issuing a stop condition is possible.",,,,,,
