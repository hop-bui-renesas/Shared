,Parameter,Description
1,Functions,". 32 bits x 2 channels (GPT32n (n = 1, 2))"
2,,". 16 bits x 4 channels (GPT16m (m = 4 to 7)) . Up-counting or down-counting (saw waves) or up/down-counting (triangle waves) for each counter . Clock sources independently selectable for each channel . Two input/output pins per channel . Two output compare/input capture registers per channel . For the two output compare/input capture registers of each channel, four registers are provided as buffer registers and are capable of operating as comparison registers when buffering is not in use . In output compare operation, buffer switching can be at crests or troughs, enabling the generation of laterally asymmetric PWM waveforms"
3,,". Registers for setting up frame cycles in each channel with capability for generating interrupts at overflow or underflow . Generation of dead times in PWM operation . Synchronous starting, stopping and clearing counters for arbitrary channels . Count start, count stop, count clear, up-count, down-count, or input capture operation in response to a maximum of 8 ELC events . Count start, count stop, count clear, up-count, down-count, or input capture operation in response to the status of two input pins . Count start, count stop, count clear, up-count, down-count, or input capture operation in response to a maximum of 4 external triggers"
4,,. Output pin disable function by detected short-circuits between output pins . - PWM waveform for controlling brushless DC motors can be generated
5,,". Compare match A to F event, and overflow/underflow event, and input LAAA/ edge event can be output to the ELC"
6,,. Enables the noise filter for input capture-and-input U\AA! . Period count function
7,,. Logical operation between the channel output
8,,". Bus clock: PCLKA, Core clock: PCLKD - Frequency ratio: PCLKA:PCLKD = 1:N (N = 1/2/4/8/16/32/64)"
