3,1,"For the Interrupt driven project S/W flow control method can be used with Extended Sleep mode only if the device connected on UART interface does send Xon/Xoff flow control bytes during sleep period, DA 14585 flows off UART data traffic but control bytes can be sent during the flow off period. The flow off signal will be lost in this case."
