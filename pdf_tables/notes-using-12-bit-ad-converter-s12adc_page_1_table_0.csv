4,We have identified some restrictions on usage of 12-Bit A/D Converter (S12ADC) in group scan mode when group A is given priority and extended operation in double trigger mode. The following describes the usage limitations and the corrections in the manual.,,,,,,
5,Usage Limitations,,,,,,
6,1) Group scan mode when group A is given priority,,,,,,
7,"At the time of the ""ADGSPCR.GBRSCN = 1"", please make peripheral Module Clock B (PCLKB) and A/D conversion clock",,,,,,
8,"ADCLK (Unit0 : PCLKC, Unit1 : PCLKD) the same frequency.",,,,,,
9,"When the limitation mentioned above does not keep, the following problems may occur.",,,,,,
10,"Though A/D conversion movement of Group B completes it and produces S12GBADI interrupt request when there is trigger input of Group A in a timing of the A/D conversion movement end of Group B, A/D conversion of Group B may work at the time of the A/D conversion end of Group A again.",,,,,,
11,"If a group-A trigger is input during A/D conversion for group B, though A/D conversion movement of Group B is completed and produces S12GBADI interrupt request, A/D conversion of Group B may work at the time of the A/D conversion end of",,,,,,
12,Group A again.,,,,,,
13,2) A/D Conversion in Extended Double Trigger Mode,,,,,,
14,"Using A/D Conversion in Extended Double Trigger Mode, when A/D conversion is stopped by ADCSR.ADST bit set to 0,",,,,,,
15,"S12ADI interrupt is occurred, but data may not be stored away by A/D Data Duplication Register A and A/D Data Duplication Register B (ADDBLDRA,ADDBLDRB).",,,,,,
16,"When A/D conversion is stopped by ADCSR.ADST bit set to 0, please do in the following procedures.",,,,,,
17,"1) To disable trigger inputs, set the ADSTRGR register to 3F3Fh.",,,,,,
18,"2) Set the ADCSR.ADIE bit to 0, and the ADCSR.GBADIE bit to 0 to disable A/D conversion end interrupt. When the A/D conversion end event in ELC is used, set the event link setting register (ELSR) using the scan end event to 0. 3) Set the ADCSR.ADST bit to 0 to perform software clear operation. Stop A/D conversion.",,,,,,
