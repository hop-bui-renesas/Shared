,#,DESCRIPTION,
1,OVERVIEW,,
2,This is a release of the DA14580 based Codeless reference design. Codeless AT Commands platform for DA14580 allows control over a local UART connected device as well as a remote device via BLE with a comprehensive set of AT commands enabling a developer to make a fast peripheral or central application (or both).,,
3,"Three AT command sources exist: - Local command source: Currently only UART 57600N1 is supported. - Remote command source: BLE connected peer, implementing codeless service. - Command sequencer: Command scripts can be executed by the command sequencer.",,
