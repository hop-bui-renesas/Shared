4,"We would like to inform you of some points on usage of the multi-function timer pulse unit 3 (MTU3). When using this module, please apply the countermeasures listed below. The descriptions in the manual will be corrected in accord with these notes.",,,,,,
5,1. Timer Output Master Enable Register (TOER) 1.1 Usage Note,,,,,,
6,"When the corresponding bit in the TOER register is changed from 1 (MTU output enabled) to 0 (MTU output disabled) while the counter is operating, a PWM waveform with a duty cycle different from that set up by the settings may be output when the corresponding bit is set to 1 again. Therefore, be sure to stop the counter first before changing a bit in the TOER register to 0.",,,,,,
7,1.2 Countermeasure,,,,,,
8,"When a bit in the TOER register is changed from 1 to 0 after the counter is started, follow the procedure below. (1) Set the bit in the timer start register (TSTR) that corresponds to the counter to 0 (which stops counting). (2) Set the bit in the TOER register to 0.",,,,,,
9,1.3 Correction in the Manual,,,,,,
10,"The following sentences are to be added to section 15.2.17, Timer Output Master Enable Register (TOER). The part in red will be added.",,,,,,
11,[After correction],,,,,,
12,"TOERA enables or disables output settings for output pins MTIOC4D, MTIOC4C, MTIOC3D, MTIOC4B, MTIOC4A, and MTIOC3B.",,,,,,
13,"TOERB enables or disables output settings for output pins MTIOC7D, MTIOC7C, MTIOC6D, MTIOC7B, MTIOC7A, and MTIOC6B.",,,,,,
14,"These pins do not output correctly if the TOER bits have not been set. In channels 3, 4, 6, and 7, set TOER prior to setting TIOR. Set the MTU.TOERA register after setting the CST3 and CST4 bits in the MTU.TSTRA register.",,,,,,
15,Set the MTU.TOERB register after setting the CST0 and CST1 bits in the MTU.TSTRB register (see Figure 15.36 and Figure 15.39).,,,,,,
