,No.,Step Name,Description
1,1,Set operating mode,Set the operating mode with the GTCR.MD[2:0] bits or GTCR.MD[3:0] bits.
2,2,Set count direction,Select the count direction (up or down) with GTUDDTYC.
3,3,Select count clock,Select the count clock with GTCR.TPCS[3:0] bits of the corresponding channel.
4,4,Set cycle,"Set the cycle in GTPR of the corresponding channel. When complementary PWM mode, set the cycle in GTPR of the master channel."
5,5,Set initial value for counter,Set the initial value in the GTCNT counter of the corresponding channel.
6,6,Inter channel cooperation synchronous clear setting (Source channel),"Set the input capture factor using GTIOCnA/B pin to GTICASR and set the same factor as the GTICSASR to the GTCSR as the count clearing factor. In addition, set GTINTAD.SCFA bit = 1b and CTCSR.CSCMSC[2:0] bit = 001b to enable sunchronous clear by the GTCCRA input capture. When complementary PWM mode, set GTINTAD of the master channel."
7,7,Inter channel cooperation synchronous clear setting (Cleared channels),Set GTCSR.CSCMSC[2:0] bits in the cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear to 111b and select the counter clear by synchronous counter clearing group.
8,8,Set group of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear,"Set the same value to GTCR.SSCGRP[1:0] bits in the source channel and cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear and set them in the same synchronous set/clear group. When complementary PWM mode, set GTCR of the master channel."
9,9,Enable inter channel cooperation synchronous clear,Set GTCR.SSCEN bits in the source channel and cleared channels of inter channel cooperation synchronous clear to enable synchronous clear.
