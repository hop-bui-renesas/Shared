3,1020.03,The prod_test.hex file might have memory alignment issues preventing its usage In SmartSnippets Toolbox RF Master or with Bluetooth tester equipment. The corresponding prod_test.bin files should be used instead.
4,1020.04,"DA14531: when _EXCLUDE_ROM_PRF_ is not defined and no BLE profiles are used in the application context, BLE_NB_USED_PROFILES must be set to 0. If not, the first four addresses of the executable - initial Stack Pointer, Reset Handler, NMI Handler and HardFault Handler - will be overwritten with zeros. Affected SDK projects: hci; ble_app_noncon; prod_test."
