4,This document describes notes on the setting procedures for the voltage monitoring 1 interrupt and voltage monitoring 2 interrupt in User's Manual: Hardware for the applicable products.,,,,,,
5,Notes,,,,,,
6,1. Note on the setting procedure for the voltage monitoring 1 interrupt,,,,,,
7,The interrupt request may not be output when setting the voltage monitoring 1 interrupt according to the setting procedure described in the user's manual while the following conditions are met.,,,,,,
8,"- The LVD1CR1.LVD1IDTSEL[1:0] bits are 01b (when drop is detected) or 10b (when drop and rise is detected), and - VCC < Vdet1.",,,,,,
9,2. Note on the setting procedure for the voltage monitoring 2 interrupt,,,,,,
10,"The interrupt request may not be output when setting the voltage monitoring 2 interrupt according to the setting procedure described in the user's manual while the following conditions are met. - The LVD2CR1.LVD2IDTSEL[1:0] bits are 01b (when drop is detected) or 10b (when drop and rise is detected), - The LVCMPCR.EXVCCINP2 bit is 0 (power supply voltage (VCC)), and - VCC < Vdet2,",,,,,,
11,or,,,,,,
12,"- The LVD2CR1.LVD2IDTSEL[1:0] bits are 01b (when drop is detected) or 10b (when drop and rise is detected), - The LVCMPCR.EXVCCINP2 bit is 1 (CMPA2 pin input voltage), and - The CMPA2 pin input voltage < Vdet2.",,,,,,
13,Counter Measure,,,,,,
14,"Wait until the output from the analog noise filter has stabilized (max. 2 us) after setting the LVDnCRO.LVDnCMPE bit (n= 1, 2) to 1, and then set the LVDnSR.LVDnDET flag to 0.",,,,,,
