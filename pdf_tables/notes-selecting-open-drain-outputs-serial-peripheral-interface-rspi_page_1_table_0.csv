6,"How to select open-drain outputs for the serial peripheral interface (RSPI) The open-drain outputs are selectable in products in 144-, 120-, 112-, and 100-pin packages, but not in those in 64- and 48-pin packages. However, even in the 144-, 120-, 112, and 100-pin versions, the open-drain output cannot be selected by following the guidance of the description in the current manual.

8,"Setting the ODRn.Bi bit to 1 described in Section 32.3.2, Controlling RSPI Pins, in RX63T Group User's Manual: Hardware Rev.2.10 does not select the open-drain output. Selecting it requires setting of the SPOM bit, which is listed as a reserved bit in Section 32.2.3, RSPI Pin Control Register (SPPCR).
